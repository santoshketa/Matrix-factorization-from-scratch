# Matrix-factorization-from-scratch
This code is example of matrix factorization used for solving optimization  problem for Recommendation systems.

Implemented code from scratch without using any inbuilt libraries.

This problem tries to factorize X matrix into product of two Matrices A and B

                                             X=A*B

This problem is solved using Gradient Descent approach
